# crypt-chunker

the purpose of this script is to allow you to encrypt your files and sync them to cloud services. the initial use case will be Box, but adding other services wouldn't be that difficult (depending on their API support). the purpose of chunking the files to standard sizes is twofold: first of all it gets around individual file size limits that most services have and second it does a bit of obscuring what you're storing.
